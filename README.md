# Super-Tic-Tac-Toe
Super-Tic-Tac-Toe is a variant of Tic-Tac-Toe. In this game, there is a large Tic-Tac-Toe grid, and inside each of the 9 grids is a smaller Tic-Tac-Toe grid. When one of these smaller Tic-Tac-Toe games are won, the smaller Tic-Tac-Toe grid will be replaced with a large X or O, which will contribute to the winning of the larger Tic-Tac-Toe grid. The game is won when the larger Tic-Tac-Toe grid is won.
